            Augmented reality (AR) murals use digital technology to overlay 2D
            and 3D animations on artworks placed in the physical environment.
            With an AR mural, viewers can use a smartphone app like{" "}
            <a href="#" className="underline">
              Artivive

            into a fully immersive experience.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            This gives artists the opportunity to play with the viewer in new
            and exciting ways, where an artwork can completely change depending
            on how the viewer interacts with it.
